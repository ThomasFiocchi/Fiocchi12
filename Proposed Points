Proposed Points:
	I believe that I deserve a 10/10 on this assignment becasue I completed it on time and in full, and had a wonderful time doing so. I have always wanted to create some sort of game using a game engine and I really enjoyed working on this project. The design I added to the game were some maze-like obstacles to make the game more challenging. I tried to add a timer into the game but I couldn't quite get it to work. Oh well, maybe next time.
